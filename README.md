# Quick Weather App


<p>The quick weather app is writen in Flutter framework and in dart language. The objective of the project serves 2 purposes. </p>
<p>1. Users can use their device's in-built GPS to retrieve the current weather information</p>
<p>2. Apart from retrieving their current location, users can also search for another location, to help them with proper planning of their activities etc.</p>

The app was also created in bid to practise dart's asynchornous programming, exception handling on try catch and also working with receving JSON data from severs such as Open Weather.

this tutorial is to learn about asynchronous programming in Dart. We'll look at how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


<h2>The App itself</h2>
The quick weather app is inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-).

<h2>Testing for Production</h2>
<p>Before running the code in Android Studio, please ensure that you have your own API key set up</p>

```navigate to services/weather.dart```

```const apiKey = 'your_API_key'```
<p>Insert your own API key</p>
<p>You can get your a valid (there is a <i>free</i> plan) API key on Open Weather's website</p>


<h2>Resources</h2>
<p>The project itself is complete and you can build your own once you clone this repository.</p>

<h2>Special Mentions</h2>
<p>Many thanks for the team at www.appbrewery.co for their wonderful courserwork and guidance in making a complicated app easy to understand in terms of the statesless, statefull, the build, the call back functions as well as the core dart language practice. </p>
